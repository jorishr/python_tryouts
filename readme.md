## Mini-Games
- **Bingo Game**: fully automated game that generates a bingo card in the terminal and crosses out matching numbers with an X. 
- **Epic Character Battle**: fully automated game whereby you can choose the name and type of your character. Health and strength stats are generated automatically. The game is a roll of the dice and the loser gets punished with a deduction of health points. The first player that ends up with 0 health points is the loser.
- **Match Tables**: No need for school. Practice your math tables from the terminal...
- **Rock, Paper, Scissors**: a classic. User input is hidden in the terminal. Graceful error handling if you enter an invalid option.
- **Guess the number**: Higher? Lower?
